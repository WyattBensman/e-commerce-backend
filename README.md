# e-commerce-backend

## Description

Through the usage of Express.js & Sequelize, I crafted an API that interacts with the SQL database of an e-commerce website. Allowing the business to efficiently create, track & obtain data from their database. This project captures the fundamental aspects of this digital marketplace, showcasing how Express.js and Sequelize work together to handle data storage and retrieval.

While not a deployed application, we're demonstrating its functionality through a walkthrough video. 

## Usage

In order to successfully run this application you must first:

1. Make sure you have Node.js & MySQL on your device
2. Clone & Navigate to the Repository
3. 'npm install' to install dependencies
4. Set up your SQL connection
5. Seed the database by running 'npm run seed'
6. Run 'node server.js' to start the server

Lastly, navigate to a tool like Postman or Insomnia to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints!
